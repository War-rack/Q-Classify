Fraudulent digital communications threaten security and privacy. This study introduces Q-Classify, a hybrid system using QSVM and VQC for spam detection. Text data is vectorized, reduced, and classified via PennyLane quantum layers. Results: QSVM hit 92.02%, while a VQC–SVM ensemble achieved 94.24%, proving QML’s potential in cybersecurity.
